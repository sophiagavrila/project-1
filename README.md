## Technical Requirements

The back-end system shall use Hibernate to connect to an AWS RDS Postgres database. The application shall deploy onto a Tomcat Server. The middle tier shall use Servlet technology for dynamic Web application development. The front-end view shall use HTML/JavaScript to make an application that can call server-side components. Passwords shall be encrypted in Java and securely stored in the database. The middle tier shall follow proper layered architecture, have reasonable (~70%) test coverage of the service layer, and implement log4j for appropriate logging. 

**Stretch Goals:**
* Replace HTML/JavaScript with an Angular single page application.
* Users can upload a document or image of their receipt when submitting reimbursements which can stored in the database and reviewed by a financial manager.
* Application shall be hosted remotely on an EC2.
* Static files (webpages) shall be hosted on an S3 bucket.
